To get support, find the latest release version of this mod, or report a bug please visit AWSOM.org or Harknell.com

KNOWN ISSUES:


1) Due to a change in WordPress 2.6 in regard to default "uploads" folder path settings and other path related changes the Default gallery path that
Pixgallery creates has now been set to simply be "/wp-content/uploads/awsompixgallery/" at plugin activation time. It would have been a real pain
to actually try to determine where this had been moved to (if it had) as well as compensate in other areas of the code. If you have moved your
default wp-content location you will need to edit this through the Manage Pixgallery Galleries admin page if you wish to use the default folder. Since
probably 99% of you guys won't actually move your wp-content folder (and there are many good reasons not to do so) I'm not too worried by this since the
few of you who do move it will easily be able to edit this setting since you are probably a more advanced WordPress user anyway.

2) Using the SEO title edit function and setting it to "Full Path" shows the actual image/gallery names, not their custom names, in the path displayed. This will be fixed in a point release later.
